    your order has been shipped or sent with DHL please contact us<br>
    So that we can handle it. So that You don't have to worry!<br>
    As for parts These can take up to 2,5 Months. Our Parts are sometimes held up by customs.<br>
    We sadly cannot control that. However We are working on small distribution centres<br>
    around certain parts in the world so that we can solve this.<br>
    <br>Do you guys wrap orders in gift wrapping<br>
    <br>Yes simply say that you want Gift wrapping in the special note or request box when you order!<br><br><br>

    So in order to help you as a customer and help you more quickly<br>
    and resolve your issue and repair in the quickest way possible <br>

    <br> what do you guys mean by lifetime warranty?<br>

    if you buy a car trough our partners yes the warranty would still be valid if you buy from a non certified dealer<br>
    the warranty wil be VOIDED and no longer supported.<br><br><br>
