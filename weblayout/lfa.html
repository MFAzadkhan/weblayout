        BUILDING A SUPERCAR<BR>
        The desire?<br>
        To create and craft a world-class supercar that challenges the finest sports cars ever built.<br>
        And so, in October 2000, Chief Engineer Haruhiko Tanahashi
        and his team embarked on their greatest engineering challenge yet.<br>
        The following ten years were spent harnessing Kaizen - Japanese for
        continuous improvements - as the unrelenting team continually reworked components of the supercar.<br>
        The LFA was born. Whilst most vehicles start with the engine, this is not the case with the LFA.
        The supercarâ€™s handling was given the utmost priority, with the packaging decided accordingly.
        The engineering team first considered how they wanted the LFA supercar to feel and how they wanted it to move.<br>
        In their determination to produce a world-class supercar, the team, helped by Yamaha, F1 and Moto GP engineers,
        manufactured a completely new V10 power plant in the purpose built factory, the LFA Works, in central Japan.
        The entire powertrain was developed exclusively for the LFA, from the transmission down to the smallest bolt.<br>
        After a decade of investment, development, and testing on the Fuji speedway, the LFA was released to the the streets.
